# SOLID_Principles_Explores

They say they best way to learn is teach. Or at least in my case my understanding is fairly good so I want to consolidate my own knowledge and share with others.

Therefore this project will see code examples which show non-solid and solid coding examples.

I will use .NET, and maybe WinForms if I need any GUIs.
